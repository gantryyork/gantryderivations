\chapter*{Overview}

\section*{Why This Book}
I was not a great math student in high school.  My grades were good, but I was learning how to apply formulas and execute methods.\\
\\
It wasn't until I took calculus at the university that I actually understood where the formulas came from.\\
\\
This was my epiphany.  This is when these symbols and operations started to mean something to me.  I would say it was analagous from going from grammar to literature.  This is when the mathematics started to tell me a story\\
\\
For many students, deriving a formula is not imporant to them since the homework sets are about apply the formula.  But if you want to truly understand a formula, it's boundary conditions, when it does and does not apply, extrapolate it beyond it's context, you must have an appreciation for the derivation.\\
\\


\section*{Terminology}
Many consider a proof and a derivation as essentially the same thing.\\
\\
A proof is when you state: If p, then q\\
\\
Here p is a fundamental statement(s) that are assumed to be true.  If you accept it to be true, it is called an \emph{axiom}.\\
\\
p is refered to as the \emph{hypothesis} or \emph{proposition}, and q is refered to as the \emph{conclusion}.\\
\\
To prove q true, one must start with p and provide a convincing argument that leads to q.\\
\\
If this is done in intermediate parts, these parts are called \emph{lemmas}.\\
\\
So after stating if p, then q, one makes derivative statements of p with the intended purpose of leading to q.  This is the \emph{derivation}.\\
\\
Derivations are also used less formally outside the context of a formal proof.\\
\\
A \emph{conjecture} is an unproven proposition that one can make a compelling but incomplete argument that it is true.  This could be a visual proof; proving it to be true for most cases; an extrapolation of logic; a demonstration of pattern; or other such reasoning.\\
